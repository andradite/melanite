#ReadME File
#####README.md

The documentation folder here will help you to understand how the project works and where certain modules of the code is located without the need to dig through source files and compare dependencies. Each file in the project has a markdown counterpart here. Many of the files in the project have had their extensions removed or modified in some way. This is generally to improve readability and file traversal throughout the project. Each file's current type and original filename will be provided at the top of each documentation file for development purposes.
Please note that changing any file names or extensions outside of the documentation folder is likely to impair the functionality of project melanite.

Check the github for any changes @andradite/melanite
