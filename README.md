#Melanite (Andradite for Windows)

This is the windows specific build of Andradite written in CRuby as opposed to the multi-platform version being written in JRuby.
This version has some slight deployment advantages since it is being developed on Windows for windows. This repo may become deprecated
as more progress is made on a multi-platform release.
