#Melanite (Andradite in C)

This is the target-platform version of Andradite written in CRuby as opposed to the multi-platform version being written in JRuby.
This version has some slight deployment advantages since it is being developed on OS for OS, however it requires multiple builds and tests for each target OS and therefore causes update-release-staggering. This repo may become deprecated as more progress is made on a multi-platform release.
